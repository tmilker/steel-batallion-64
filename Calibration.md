Z-Rotation, is complicated.  This was an experimental mode I created.  Left thumbstick values are combined with the left Joystick.  Additionally, the level of combination is controlled by the left hand throttle.  Move the throttle all the way up and the thumbstick moves the axis considerably.  Throttle all the way down to "R" and the joystick emulates the Left and Right keys.

**Move the throttle to position "R".  Move the Left block joystick all the way to the left and Right LEAVE thumbstick alone**
Theoretical range -127 - 127
