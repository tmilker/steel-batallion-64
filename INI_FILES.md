# INI modification #
The current INI system is going to be replaced.  I put this in place so I wouldn't have to recompile everytime I made a change.  Its clunky and nonintuitive at the moment, but if you want to give it a go while I get Version 2.0 ready, here is how it works.  Make a copy of MW4.ini before you start.  Because of the way of how I designed the driver, you can't make any changes that will cause any real damage.  The worst thing that could happen is the executable might crash, in which case you can just make use of your original .ini file again.
